<h2>Data Preprocessing and Acquisition</h2>
  I acquired the data from open-source galleries on Flickr and resized them for normalization for batch processing using OS and OpenCV. The data is too large to upload, so I have excluded it.
<h2>Methods</h2>
  I used the OpenCV library to convert the image to their respective hues and saturation values to be displayed on a histogram using the MATLAB pyplot library.
